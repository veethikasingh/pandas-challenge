# pandas-challenge

**Instructions**
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Hint: Check out the sample solution called PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb located in the .zip file to review the desired format for this assignment.

**District Summary**
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:

Total number of unique schools

Total students

Total budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

**School Summary**
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Include the following:

School name

School type

Total students

Total school budget

Per student budget

Average math score

Average reading score

% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

**Math Scores by Grade**
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Reading Scores by Grade**
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Scores by School Spending**
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

Use the code provided below to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending.
